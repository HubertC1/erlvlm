## Overview
This is the official implementation of **ERL-VLM** for MetaWorld tasks.

## Installation

```
conda create --name erlvlm python=3.9
conda activate erlvlm
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps
pip install -e .
```

## Setup Gemini Key:
1. Obtain a Gemini API key: Follow the instructions at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Enable parallel querying: We support querying Gemini in parallel using multiple keys, which can speed up the querying process. Place your API keys in `gemini_keys.py` and adjust parameters `n_processes_query` accordingly.

## Run experiments
```
bash scripts/open_drawer/run_ERLVLM.sh
bash scripts/soccer/run_ERLVLM.sh
bash scripts/sweep_into/run_ERLVLM.sh
```
